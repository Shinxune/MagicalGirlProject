<p class="Chapter1">“Um…” Taylor doesn’t know what to say, she’s never really seen Chris upset like that
     “I should go make sure she’s okay …I’ll see you later Clover” and she goes after her sister.

<p class="Chapter1">“What the hell clover” the ghost starts.

<p class="Chapter1">She looks at the ghost with disbelief.
<p class="Chapter1">“Why would you upset Chris like that?”
<p class="Chapter1">“What?”
<p class="Chapter1">“You just laughed at her like that, why would you do that?”
<p class="Chapter1">“I didn’t mean anything by it” She defends herself “I just didn’t want to enter.”
<p class="Chapter1">The ghost once again crosses her arms
     “You didn’t need to make her feel shitty about wanting to enter.”
<p class="Chapter1">“Why the hell are you even talking to me?” Clover spats.
<p class="Chapter1">“Becauuuuse you’re the only one who can see me? The whip chose yoooou?
     So here I am?” She says like Clovers acting stupid.
<p class="Chapter1">Clover quickly packs away her laptop and practically runs back to the dorms.
<p class="Chapter1">Outside the humidity is still heavy with the end of summer heat.
     Clover doesn’t bother taking her sweatshirt off.
<p class="Chapter1">	“Back to the dorm already? 
    I thought you needed to finish your essay and go see your teacher” Ghost says.
<p class="Chapter1">Clover doesn’t look at her
<p class="Chapter1">“Oh my god! Ignore me or talk to me! PICK ONE!” she groans “you’re so annooooying.”
<p class="Chapter1">“I picked that one! I’ll be annoying.”
<p class="Chapter1">“Annoyings a shitty personality” Ghost mutters “I thought you were going to be cool,
     you literally fought a kraken but you're so” she balls her fists “UGH!” 
<p class="Chapter1">Clover stomps across the grass, anything to push her faster to the dorm. She needed to do this right now!! 
    She couldn’t stand another second of this Ghost! She needed her gone!
<p class="Chapter1">“What are you so mad about?” The ghost crosses her arms and they go into the elevator together.
<p class="Chapter1">Clover thinks for a second that it’s a bad idea to go into the small confined space with a ghost, but also… she didn’t think she’d do anything. She trusted it that much. But nonetheless,
    she watched the ghost floating there the entire time. She looked more annoyed than anything.
<p class="Chapter1">Finally the elevator dings on the second floor and she moves past the people getting on, the ghost floats through them, leaving shivers and goosebumps wherever she goes. Her dorm is… cleaner than the morning she left it. Not a single sign of glitter…. But it did smell like sewers and seaweed. She slams the door shut, she didn’t think too hard about the other people in the building that might have heard it. 
    She goes right for the drawer that she shoved that whip into.
<p class="Chapter1">“What are you doing with that?” The ghost asks, not liking the sinister smile on Clover's face.
<p class="Chapter1">Clover pulls it out, the mess of shirts coming out with it “You and it, are going to the big racoon that lives behind the school”
<p class="Chapter1">“Noooo we’re not!”
<p class="Chapter1">“Yup!”
<p class="Chapter1">“Don't you dare!”
<p class="Chapter1">“And what are you going to do about it?” Clover smirks, and then walks through freezing cold spirit.
<p class="Chapter1">“STOP!” The ghost yells.
<p class="Chapter1">Clover walks her way all the way out the building and headed to the dumpsters at the back.
<p class="Chapter1">	“NO!” She yells, and reaches out, gripping Clovers arm. It shocks both the girls and there’s a flash of light and blues, and glitter. Clover stands right infront of her college for the whole world to see in a blue spandex suit. She frantically looks around making sure noone saw! But who know! There’s so many windows around anyone could have been looking at the right moment.
<p class="Chapter1">The ghost blinks, looking from her hand to the wide eyed look on Clover face “... I’m going to do that incase you were wondering!”
<p class="Chapter1">Clover looks down at ehr clothes and the floors, and back up at Ghost. She has a massive white tooth grin on her face, looking down at the now red head girl.
<p class="Chapter1">“I Still think your outfit looks great.”
<p class="Chapter1">“WHAT DID YOU DO?!”
