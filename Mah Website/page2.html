    <div class="myDivtwo Grad">
       

<P class="Chapter1"> “OW” The purple girl groans “Took you freaking long enough” she quickly flies out
    from under the tentacle, rubbing her head. “That freakin’ hurt.”
    Actually, taking a look now, she doesn’t recognize the girl currently using her
    strength to fight against the tentacle attempting to crush her.
<P class="Chapter1"> Purple girl rubs her head “Who are you?”
 
<P class="Chapter1"> “WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS?!” Clover yells holding up the tentacle still.

<P class="Chapter1"> “Uh.” Quickly, the purple girl grabs the next lamp post, pulling it out of the cement 
    and holding it like a spear. “I got this.”

<P class="Chapter1"> She stabs it through the tentacle, right in front of Clover's face, and into the
    concrete. The monster screeches, and Clover stares at the hunk of metal that nearly
    missed her.
    
<P class="Chapter1">“You almost hit me!” The girl looks at her for a second, ignoring the question.

<P class="Chapter1"> The purple girl cuts her off  “Who are you?” 

<P class="Chapter1">“Uh… Clover” The girl continues to look her up and down. 

<P class="Chapter1">“I’ve never seen you here before.” 

<P class="Chapter1">“I’ve never been in a battle before! What should I do?!”

<P class="Chapter1">“IRIS! You flew off way to fast!” A stream of red light flies at them. A girl with curly
    blond hair in red spandex appears next to them “we weren’t even done with the
    Briefing!”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“There was a monster in the city! There’s no time for a briefing!” Iris yells back. 

<P class="Chapter1">The blonde looks at Clover, and she can't help but freeze up under her intense look “Who are you?”
<P class="Chapter1">“Clover.” She responds.

<P class="Chapter1">The blonde girl looks her over, the same as the other had, and then looks at Iris.
    She shrugs, “She was here when I got here.”
   
<P class="Chapter1">The blonde girl nods. “Well, I’m Ember, nice to meet you Clover!” she smiles
    brightly “I haven’t seen you around before!”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“This is… new.” She gestures to her whole outfit.

<P class="Chapter1">“A NEW MAGIC GIRL?!” she gasps, her smile somehow getting wider. “This is
    great! We could really use the help.”
    
<P class="Chapter1">The purple girl mumbles something under her breath and flies at the monster
    attacking the city.
    
<P class="Chapter1"> “Come on, let's deal with this thing, and we can chat afterward.” Ember winks,
    and in a flash is up in the sky.
    
<P class="Chapter1">Clover watches from the ground “I can’t do that!”

<P class="Chapter1"> “Get up there!”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“Who the hell keeps talking?!” Clover yells, there's still no one around her.

<P class="Chapter1">Suddenly a massive tentacle swipes through the buildings, slamming into Clover.
    “AHHHH!!!!” She goes flying through the air with the carnage “SHIT!”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“FLY!” The voice screams at her!

<P class="Chapter1">It was either fly or die! Clover spreads out her arms and suddenly she’s up right.

<P class="Chapter1">Hovering above the ground like gravity wasn’t going to pull her down.
    “OH MY GOD” she gasps for breath, and drops to her feet, her legs giving out
    and leaving her sitting on the soaking wet road.
    

<P class="Chapter1">“Are you okay?”
<P class="Chapter1">Clover looks up at a glowing girl with pigtails and glowing roller skates.
    “Of course, another magic girl.”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“Hi I’m Star!” She smiles brightly.

<P class="Chapter1" style="font-size: xx-large;"> ...𓆩♡𓆪...


<P class="Chapter1">Ember uppercuts the monster in its weird face. Chipping its beak.
“Iris!” She yells “Stop flying off, we’re supposed to be doing this together!”

<P class="Chapter1">Iris, in a purple blur, grabs another tentacle and swiftly locks that one down the
    same way as the first, impaling it on a lamppost. She wipes sweat off her brow. “I'M
    DOING MY JOB!” she yells “Maybe you should move a little faster, instead of getting
    stuck in meetings.”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“UGH!” Ember groans “Why can’t you just listen?!”

<P class="Chapter1">Iris goes off again, dancing with the next tentacle and attempting to grab the flailing limb.
Ember rolls her eyes, the sound of a helicopter draws her attention. 

<P class="Chapter1">Off in the distance is a helicopter circling from afar. Obviously hooked up with a camera. News
    reporters. Ember looks around. Iris is still messing up the monster very efficiently, and the ground is flooding with water mixed with the monster's dark blue blood. It was starting to smell too.
    “Crap.” She groans.
    
<P class="Chapter1">Suddenly, she's slammed into by a tentacle, and driven into the ground. Water
    and blood goes up her nose and into her mouth. The weight is quickly removed and she
    sits up, coughing and gasping for breath!
    “AGH HAAACK!” She spits it out.

    
<P class="Chapter1">“Are you okay?!” Clover rushes to her side.

<P class="Chapter1">Ember looks up at the bright  red haired girl from before, and another girl, someone she
Recognizes. “Star, where did you come from?”

<P class="Chapter1">“My shift just started, thought I’d come by and help” She smiles, pumping her
    fists raring to go! “I ran into…Clover here.” She gestures to the new person.
    
<P class="Chapter1">Ember wipes the blood from her nose and mouth. That monster hit her hard. She
    kneels on the ground, Star putting a hand on her shoulder.
    “I’m good, I'm good….” She takes a deep breath.
    
<P class="Chapter1">Another loud thud and a screech reveal that Iris was successful in impaling
    another tentacle.
    Ember sighs “We gotta finish this quick, there’s a news crew in that helicopter
    over there, and this is getting too bloody. Make quick work of it. Get those tentacles
    under control.”
    
<P class="Chapter1">Star quickly pulls a spear out of nowhere; it's made of lightning and looks deadly.

<P class="Chapter1">“New girl, what do you got?”

<P class="Chapter1">“Uhhhhh” Clover looks over at herself, the blue rubber and spandex had no
    pockets! At her hip a glowing blue whip appears. “I have this?”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“That should work great! Try tying up the tentacles!” Ember tells her.

<P class="Chapter1">Clover looks at the monster, from the ground, as Star and Iris work effortlessly to
    fight off the creature's flailing arms.
    
<P class="Chapter1">“Get in there!” Ember shouts.

<P class="Chapter1">“GO!” The voice yells.

<P class="Chapter1">Clover is flying once again, way faster than she means to, right into a tentacle. It
    throws her off, and she flicks out the whip!
    
<P class="Chapter1"> “AH! I GOT IT!” Clover exclaims with a smile. She had used the whip to tie up the tentacle! Though all it was
    attached to was the handle in her hand.
    
<P class="Chapter1">The tentacle raises and flails side to side.

<P class="Chapter1">“AHHHH!!!” Clover screams still launching onto the handle. 
    A flash of blue electricity, loud cracking sounds and a pop. 
    And all the town goes dark. No one moves, the sound of the helicopter and sirens 
    are all they can hear out in the dark.

<P class="Chapter1">“...Am I alive?” Clover calls out.
<P class="Chapter1">“Yup!” A sarcastic voice responds “Overkill much?”

<P class="Chapter1">“Ember said to do it!” Clover replies.

<P class="Chapter1">“I didn’t know you were going to do that!” Ember responds. “I just meant hold down
    the tentacles, not start a city wide blackout!”
    
<P class="Chapter1">“Well. I didn’t know I was going to do that either!”
