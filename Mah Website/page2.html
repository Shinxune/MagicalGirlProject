<P> “OW” The purple girl groans “Took you freaking long enough” she quickly flies out
    from under the tentacle, rubbing her head. “That freakin’ hurt.”
    Actually, taking a look now, she doesn’t recognize the girl currently using her
    strength to fight against the tentacle attempting to crush her.
<P> Purple girl rubs her head “Who are you?”
 
<P> “WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS?!” Clover yells holding up the tentacle still.

<P> “Uh.” Quickly, the purple girl grabs the next lamp post, pulling it out of the cement 
    and holding it like a spear. “I got this.”

<P> She stabs it through the tentacle, right in front of Clover's face, and into the
    concrete. The monster screeches, and Clover stares at the hunk of metal that nearly
    missed her.
    
<P>“You almost hit me!” The girl looks at her for a second, ignoring the question.

<P> The purple girl cuts her off  “Who are you?” 

<P>“Uh… Clover” The girl continues to look her up and down. 

<P>“I’ve never seen you here before.” 

<P>“I’ve never been in a battle before! What should I do?!”

<P>“IRIS! You flew off way to fast!” A stream of red light flies at them. A girl with curly
    blond hair in red spandex appears next to them “we weren’t even done with the
    Briefing!”
    
<P>“There was a monster in the city! There’s no time for a briefing!” Iris yells back. 

<P>The blonde looks at Clover, and she can't help but freeze up under her intense look “Who are you?”
<P>“Clover.” She responds.

<P>The blonde girl looks her over, the same as the other had, and then looks at Iris.
    She shrugs, “She was here when I got here.”
   
<P>The blonde girl nods. “Well, I’m Ember, nice to meet you Clover!” she smiles
    brightly “I haven’t seen you around before!”
    
<P>“This is… new.” She gestures to her whole outfit.

<P>“A NEW MAGIC GIRL?!” she gasps, her smile somehow getting wider. “This is
    great! We could really use the help.”
