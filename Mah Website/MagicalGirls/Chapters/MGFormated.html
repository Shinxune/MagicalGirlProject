Clover holds her hood</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">against her head, the material soaks up the water and the cold breeze freezes</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">her to the bone. She shivers. The sun was setting and taking the warmth with it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be summer! Why is it so cold?!&rdquo; she whines.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She keeps moving forward against the icy breeze. She promised her friends she was going to meet them for dinner! And she was already closer to the restaurant than the dorms, there was no turning back.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly the ground shakes. Clover stops. Looking around, the people around</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">her on the street also stopped. They all look at each other &hellip; Clover sniffs smelling sea</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">salt. Odd since they were nowhere near the ocean.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Again the ground rumbles. And again, this time there&rsquo;s an audible thud!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover holds her breath. She&rsquo;s looking at the ground&hellip;. Waiting for it to happen</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">again. Would it be bigger? Louder, more violent?The street grows dark. So dark.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover looks up, seeing a large monster looming above the tall buildings. It&#39;s</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">almost like her and the beast share a moment of silence. Then a silhouette of a large tentacle raises up into the air. Almost in slow motion, it slaps the building throwing rubble everywhere. Its large single eye looking down at her, and a gaping beak.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyone screams and starts running, Clover is frozen in place. Her legs won&#39;t</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">move. She screams. Then BAM! She&rsquo;s slapped in the face, thrown back, hitting the concrete sidewalk.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She frantically grabs at the thing wrapped around her head. Finally getting it off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What the hell is this?&rdquo; She looks at the long cord in her hand. It starts glowing</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">blue. It glows brighter and she&#39;s enveloped in a warm light.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly she&rsquo;s dry, and warm. The light disappears. She looks down at herself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Covered in blue glitter and an outfit that looks like it&rsquo;s made of rubber, but fits so perfect</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">and comfortable. &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;GRRRRRRAAAA!!!&rdquo; The monster screeches! And behind it a wave taller than every building.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;AHHH!&rdquo; she screams, the water slams down on her, and the current takes her</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">down the street. Her head bangs against a curb, and the water passes over her. </span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She stays lying there,disoriented. &ldquo;Ughhh&hellip;.&rdquo; she blinks, the dizziness not going away.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She swears she sees a streak of neon purple above her. &ldquo;GET UP!&rdquo; a voice screams.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover forces herself to her elbows. Looking around, her eyes focus again, no ones around her.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The creature roars again! The stream of purple charges a tentacle, and impales it</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">on a lamp post! The monster screams!</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover blinks. &ldquo;GET UP AND HELP!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover looks around again, there&rsquo;s no one there.

Obviously hooked up with a camera. New</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">reporters. Ember looks around. Iris is still messing up the monster very efficiently, and the ground is flooding with water mixed with the monster&#39;s dark blue blood. It was starting to smell too.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo; She groans.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly, she&#39;s slammed into by a tentacle, and driven into the ground. Water</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">and blood goes up her nose and into her mouth. The weight is quickly removed and she</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">sits up, coughing and gasping for breath!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;AGH HAAACK!&rdquo; She spits it out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo; Clover rushes to her side.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ember looks up at the bright &nbsp;red haired girl from before, and another girl, someone she</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Recognizes. &ldquo;Star, where did you come from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My shift just started, thought I&rsquo;d come by and help&rdquo; She smiles, pumping her</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">fists raring to go! &ldquo;I ran into&hellip;Clover here.&rdquo; She gestures to the new person.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Ember wipes the blood from her nose and mouth.

At her hip a glowing blue whip appears. &ldquo;I have this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That should work great! Try tying up the tentacles!&rdquo; Ember tells her.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover looks at the monster, from the ground, as Star and Iris work effortlessly to</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">fight off the creature&#39;s flailing arms.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get in there!&rdquo; Ember shouts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;GO!&rdquo; The voice yells.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Clover is flying once again, way faster than she means to, right into a tentacle. It</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">throws her off, and she flicks out the whip!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;AH! I GOT IT!&rdquo; Clover exclaims with a smile. She had used the whip to tie up the tentacle! Though all it was</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">attached to was the handle in her hand.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The tentacle raises and swings side to side.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;AHHHH!!!&rdquo; Clover screams still launching onto the handle. A flash of blue electricity, loud cracking sounds and a pop. And all the town goes dark. No one moves, the sound of the helicopter and sirens are all they can hear out in the dark.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Am I alive?&rdquo; Clover calls out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo; A sarcastic voice responds &ldquo;Overkill much?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ember said to do it!&rdquo; Clover replies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going to do that!&rdquo; Ember responds. &ldquo;I just meant hold down</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">the tentacles, not start a city wide blackout!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well.

In a flash of bright light she&rsquo;s back in her jeans and puffy jacket. She stretches her arms above her head and takes a deep breath. She then grabs her box of cigarettes and lighter from her back pocket. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leans against the brick wall and closes her eyes, taking a long drag of the cigarette. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power out, and it being the middle of the night, everything is quiet. Back in the far distance she can make out the sounds of the helicopters and sirens. Her phone buzzes in her other pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She groans, takes another breath of smoke, and answers it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ember!

The sidewalk is dark as she walks to the fully lit building. It&rsquo;s like a beacon in the night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walks up to the gate of the large factory and parking lot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; She waves to the gate attendant, who barely looks up from his phone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He mutters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">She walks across the parking lot, and dreads walking in through the door. The AC hits her in the face! Making her nose and ears hurt! The lobby lights reflect off the white floor tiles, and she squints to see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi Amber!&rdquo; The girl at the front desk waves rapidly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Amber smiles, &ldquo;Hi Tambra.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been?

The offices. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">This floor is just as cold as all the others, but this one has stuffy carpets, all the offices have windows, but all the blinds are shut. At the end of the hall is a door with a bronze name plate, with a gold name scrawled into it.

And only when the sun begins to rise, and the dark sky lightens just a bit, and the birds begin chirping, does she dare close her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of loud knocking makes her jump! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;CLOVER!&rdquo; Someone yells &ldquo;OPEN THE DOOR!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover quickly gets up, her vision blurs, and she has to use the bed to help her stand up. The knocking continues, she quickly shakes it off and goes to answer her door. Her eyes catch the whip hanging off the second desk in the room. She presses her lips together and looks at the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;CLOVER!&rdquo; her friend yells again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly Clover grabs the whip and shoves it into one of her dresser drawers, under all the clothes out of sight. Then she goes to answer the door for her frantic friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment she opens it, Chris leaps forward in a mess of frizzy blond hair, giving Clover a arm pinning hug &ldquo;Are you okay?!&rdquo; Chris yells. &ldquo;We were worried about you! You&rsquo;re okay, right? Last night was so scary!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Clover reassures her, attempting to pull her arms out of her grip and take a step away, Chris hangs on tight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure? You never made it to the restaurant last night!&rdquo; Chris states. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know if you were okay!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, I&hellip;&rdquo; she thinks for a second &ldquo;...I was just barely leaving when things started, and I made it back here as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris pats down Clover&#39;s arms, feeling for any wounds, Clover shifts uncomfortably trying to shake her friend off without being rude, Chris sniffs her and her nose scrunches up. &ldquo;You smell like fish.&rdquo; she looks at the red head&#39;s clothes. &ldquo;And why are you covered in glitter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover looks down at herself, glitter is dried into her clothes, she looks at where she was sitting on her bed, more glitter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhhhh, I got stuck in the rain, and then one of the magical girls flew right over me.&rdquo; She laughs nervously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which one?!&rdquo; Chris asks impatiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The &hellip; blue one?&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;THE NEW ONE?!&rdquo; She yells &ldquo;EVERYONE&rsquo;S TALKING ABOUT HER!&rdquo; She says &ldquo;When I got service again this morning, I saw her everywhere!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everywhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;EVERY. WHERE. news stations are going crazy for her wondering who she is, and people are asking so many questions. Tell. Me. EVERYTHING.&rdquo; Chris looks her in the eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhhhhhh&hellip;.&rdquo; Clover grabs her phone out of her pocket, it doesn&rsquo;t turn on &ldquo;She just flew right over me&hellip; and away&rdquo; Clover looks Chris in the eyes, waiting for her to say anything. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So why do you still smell like fish?&rdquo; Chris asks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I uhhh&hellip; was too freaked out to go shower when I got back and the power was out&rdquo; She wipes her sweaty palms on her pants. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;UGH That power outage sucked! We were stuck at the restaurant with a bunch of people, Taylor was freaking out the whole time, she was crying and wanting to go home the whole time, but I sat there and held her hand the whole time.&rdquo; She says triumphantly with her hands on her hips. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover pressed her lips together to keep herself from chuckling at that, she had a hard time believing it was Taylor who was the one crying, and that she wasn&rsquo;t the one doing the hand holding &ldquo;yeah I bet that&rsquo;s how it went.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Taylor can get so scared sometimes&rdquo; she laughs, suddenly she turns serious &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep up on all the news&rdquo; Chris walks farther into the room, smelling the air, and looking at the mess, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no confirmation on how the Kraken made it into the middle of town, it&rsquo;s miles from the ocean!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They don&#39;t know?&rdquo; Clover attempts to play it off like she doesn&rsquo;t already know. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yea it appeared out of nowhere and just started attacking the town! Which is so weird, Krakens don&rsquo;t like coming to the surface of the ocean, but this one snuck onto land and started attacking, that&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Clover laughs nervously &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that&rdquo; she looks at the glitter stuck to her bed sheets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah! Krakens don&rsquo;t do that. They don&rsquo;t just rampage&rdquo; Chris scrolls through her phone and flashes Clover, a wiki about Krakens before scrolling to the next thing about magical girl sightings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover spots a flash of blue before Chris shoves her phone in her pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And we got it to stop!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover jumps.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Behind Chris, the blue glowing ghost pops out of the closet door. Clover stares at her wide eyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris notices her reaction and quickly looks behind her &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Then back at Clover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Y-...&rdquo; Clover just stares between the two &ldquo;...you don&#39;t see it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris does a double take. &ldquo;No, what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost smirks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry girlie pop, they don&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo; She chuckles. She floats out of the mirror and stands next to Clover. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Clover!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover looks at Chris. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Chris asks, looking concerned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Um&hellip; I just thought&hellip; there was a spider.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost chuckles. &ldquo;Heh, good cover, you don&rsquo;t want your friends to know you&rsquo;re seeing a ghost, good idea, they might think you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s another knock on the door. Startling Clover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Taylor, she went to get some work from a teacher.&rdquo; Chris says with an eye roll, and answers the door for her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; Clover rubs her head, daring to take one more look at the ghost in the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost winks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris swings the door open &ldquo;Taylor finally!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take that long.&rdquo; The taller sister sighs. &ldquo;So, are we going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost floats over getting between the sisters as if she&rsquo;s part of the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh I didn&rsquo;t even ask yet.&rdquo; Chris admits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even ask yet?&rdquo; The tall one looks at her sister annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris laughs &ldquo;Right, Clover, do you want to sleep over at our place tonight?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh ummm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Since there&#39;s no classes for the rest of the day, and we figured it might be a little freaky staying on your own after what happened, we thought it&rsquo;d be nice to invite you over.&rdquo; Taylor continues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glances at the ghost between them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I would love to!&rdquo; She says cheerfully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;YAY!!!&rdquo; Chris cheers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Taylor claps her hands together, &ldquo;We were just stopping by here, but we can wait for you if you need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We gotta wait,&rdquo; Chris chuckles, &ldquo;she&#39;s gotta shower.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover&#39;s face goes red, and suddenly she&rsquo;s overcome with the stench of sewer water and seasalt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right&hellip; that won&#39;t take too long.&rdquo; She says quickly grabbing her bathroom things and plugging her phone in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get ready quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rush.&rdquo; Chris flops down on her bed, avoiding the most glittery parts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were supposed to stop here early so you could give her a heads up.&rdquo; Taylor pokes Chris&#39;s nose. &ldquo;And careful, don&rsquo;t track that glitter home, it&rsquo;ll get everywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Chris just laughs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover quickly does what she has to do in the bathroom, brushing her hair and teeth in front of the mirror. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your friends seem really nice.&rdquo; The ghost shoots out of the tiled floor, and sits on the next sink.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover goes still with the tooth brush in her mouth, and stares intently at the faucet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ignore me forever, Clover.&rdquo; She stretches her arms out, and rests them behind her head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover watches herself in the mirror intently, and keeps brushing her teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">While packing her backpack, Clover keeps glancing at the drawer where she shoved the whip. Hidden under her clothes. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good to go.&rdquo; She slings her bag over her shoulders. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great! We&rsquo;re going to stop at the convenience store on the way home and get a bunch of snacks!&rdquo; Chris cheers!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly Clover can feel her very light wallet in her pocket. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;S-sounds good.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover follows behind the sisters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You left it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover doesn&rsquo;t turn to the voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good to leave important things behind.&rdquo; The ghost adds. Clover resists looking at her, making a point to look anywhere else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Outside smells like seasalt, and feels like warm sunshine. The humidity is like a thick cloud in the air. Clover stretches and yawns. She looks up at the sky, a flock of large birds fly by, a feather the size of her arm slowly falls and gets picked up by the breeze, into the road, where it gets run over by a car. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice out,&rdquo; she smiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping it doesn&rsquo;t rain anymore, it&#39;s going to flood after that Kraken&rdquo; Taylor comments mostly to herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look ready to sleep already,&rdquo; Chris chuckles. &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not allowed to do that until after we play Mario Kart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Chris pulls Clover by the arm, so she&rsquo;s walking next to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover laughs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never played before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; Chris&rsquo;s smile gets bigger, and she rubs her hands together. &ldquo;Fresh meat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She will kick our butts, we will lose.&rdquo; Taylor notifies her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; Clover says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">They stop at Zapgas, the gas station all the students use to get their snacks. It&rsquo;s packed, everyone decided today to come get more snacks, and Clover could hear everyone. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I missed the end of the broadcast! My phone died before I could see what happened&rdquo; says someone in the chip aisle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That new magical girl just flew off without saying anything!&rdquo; Someone responds to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She looked kind of familiar, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; Someone asks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I can&#39;t tell any of them apart.&rdquo; Someone else comments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve seen someone new showup.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of excited! I&#39;m trying to find them on Sparkleapp, but none of the other girls are following her.&rdquo; Someone says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover quickly takes out her phone, just barely at 10%, to check Sparkleapp.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you&hellip;&rdquo; Says the ghost. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover doesn&rsquo;t listen, she goes right to Ember&#39;s page, and sure enough on her latest picture of her, a selfie with an ant -like view of the city under her. #protectingOceanside. All the comments are asking about the new girl! Who, what, where, why, how?!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">She keeps scrolling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop reading those,&rdquo; The ghost says again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Clover!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">She jumps, Chris has an armful of different chip bags.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which one of these are your favorites?&rdquo; She holds them all up higher.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Taylor&rsquo;s grabbing one at a time, attempting to put them back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good with any.&rdquo; Clover says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Chris narrows her eyes. &ldquo;...which one is your favorite, though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Any-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;FAVORITE!&rdquo; She yells.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Doritos!&rdquo; Clover replies, &ldquo;Doritos are good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Chris gets a bag of both flavors. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are Doritos your favorite?&rdquo; The ghost asks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover doesn&rsquo;t reply, but takes one last glance at the barbeque flavored chips. They move onto drinks, getting a few different things. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The girls wait outside to catch the bus. While watching someone push a massive raccoon off their car, who has gnawed through their car tire. The ghost stands next to Clover, the icy presence of hers giving the girl goosebumps. She shivers. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; Taylor asks. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c21">&ldquo;No, I&#39;m okay.&rdquo; Clover responds.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c5 c2"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 366.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 366.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c2 c7 title" id="h.ppkvbw6o19il"><span class="c9">Chapter 5 </span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0">The bus drops the three girls off at a bus stop in front of a shopping plaza, and they walk through a nice neighborhood of green lawns and large yards. Clover looks over all the houses noticing every detail, perfectly mowed lawns and fences with potted plants around them. </span></p><p class="c3 c5 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c2 c4"><span class="c0">A massive bird lands &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover waits for the other 2 to step over the threshold of the welcome mat. Taylor and Chris both walk in with their shoes on. The side door opens into a really nice looking kitchen. Clover hangs by the door for a second longer, waiting for one of them to say something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is a nice place&rdquo; The ghost floats by effortlessly, looking over the nice painted walls with framed pictures and&hellip; fake potted plants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Should I take my shoes off?&rdquo; Clover asks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can if you want to&rdquo; Chris says walking to the counter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylors already walking up the stairs that are on the right of the room that split the very clean kitchen from a very clean living room. Clover decides to keep her shoes on like the other two had, and places her plastic bag on the dark marble island as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost floats into the house, over to an array of family photos right before the stairs. Looking closely at them. The girls and their parents are happily on vacation at a beach, a gap-toothed Taylor is holding a large fish in one, and Chris celebrating her 5th birthday in another with frosting all over her face. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just make yourself at home&rdquo; Chris calls out, and walks down a hall off of the kitchen, and Clover hears a door shut. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Clover stands still looking intently at the counter trying to pretend there&rsquo;s no one else in the room. She focuses on the bowl of fruit next to their bags of convenience store snacks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">The ghost flies across the kitchen popping her head into their cabinets &ldquo;Holy crap! they have a really nice place!&rdquo; the ghost turns and looks at her, Clover keeps her eyes straight forward, the ghost floats up by her &ldquo;this is your first time here too isn&rsquo;t it, you look so awkward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Clover tenses up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Taylor comes back down already switched into a pair of sweats and T-shirt, her cropped black hair pulled back in a ponytail and headband.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did Chris just leave you here?&rdquo; She looks down the hall where Chris had gone and sighs &ldquo;well the bathroom is down that way&rdquo; she motions down the hall chris disappeared down &ldquo;and if you want water the glasses are here next to the sink, and use the fridge not the faucet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Taylor grabs a glass for herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Clover relaxes, and nods. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Taylor leans against the counter &ldquo;So you and Chris are in calculus together?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes we are,&rdquo; Clover responds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Taylor nods &ldquo;does she actually do the work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t stand numbers and hates math, she wouldn&rsquo;t be taking it if she didn&rsquo;t need to.

They all sit down on Chris&rsquo; extremely plush daybed overstuffed with pink and white pillows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Clover does her best to control her princess peach, the large twelfth place on her side of the screen and Chris with her golden number one. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to boost when you turn,&rdquo; Chris says.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; have no idea what that means!!!&rdquo; Clover shakes the controller in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor sits up putting her phone down.

The ghost who&rsquo;s sitting on the floor bored perks up, turning her head. She rests her chin on the side of the bed and smiles, looking at the girl in question. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;LET ME SEE!&rdquo; while still holding first place and crossing the finishing line Chris reaches across Clover for her sister&#39;s phone. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">Clover&rsquo;s eyes glance to the ghost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking about us&rdquo; the ghost sings, and she smoothly floats off the ground and over Chris&rsquo;s shoulder.

Better not to get involved in this &ldquo;I think I need to go to the bathroom&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover gets up from the bed leaving the two bickering.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you should take something other than kaiju studies, Chris, and focus on getting a real job,&rdquo; Taylor says.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kaiju studies is a real career path!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover picks up her pace heading downstairs. &nbsp;Clover quickly gets up and retreats out of the room and quickly down the stairs. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&#39;s everything up there?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover jumps and sees Taylor and Chris&rsquo; mom looking over the back of the couch. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good, everything&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you guys need anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No we&rsquo;re good, I just needed to use the bathroom&rdquo; Clover pulls on the sleeves of her shirt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right down the hall sweetie!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Clover quickly makes it out of there. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">In the bathroom she flops against the door and takes a deep breath. Trying to steady her shaking hands. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re loving this new magical girl!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;AH!&rdquo; Clover opens her eyes, in the mirror across the room is the ghost!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright in there?!&rdquo; Clover hears the girl&#39;s mom ask.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, just a spider!&rdquo; she calls back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seeing a lot of spiders aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the glowing blue apparition smirks. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Leave me alone&rdquo; Clover hisses under her breath.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost rolls her eyes and floats out the mirror, gracefully sitting herself down on the counter &ldquo;why&rsquo;d you leave the whip back at your dorm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was hoping it would leave YOU there with it&rdquo; she points her finger. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&rdquo;Nope, I&#39;ll go where you go&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost shrugs &ldquo;well&hellip; you&rsquo;re the only one that can see me, soooo&hellip; here I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go find someone else to see you&rdquo; Clover grits her teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nope, you&rsquo;re it&rdquo; she smiles brightly &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m a great roommate! I love gossiping, talking, and watching movies! We&rsquo;ll have a great time!

I&rsquo;ll be upstairs with the girls!&rdquo; She waves and floats through the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover stares at the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost pops her head back out &ldquo;by the way, just call me Ghost I think that&rsquo;s simple enough right?&rdquo; she laughs and peaces out.</span></p><p class="c1 c5 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2 c7 title" id="h.wlymwksgcrrr"><span class="c9">Chapter 6 </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Clover pries her tired eyes open, and there&#39;s two dark blue ones staring back at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; the ghost smiles brightly, Clover feels her icey breath on her face &ldquo;how did you sleep?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without responding Clover sits up looking around the room, next to her Chris is curled up. Very awkwardly Clover crawls over her friend to get out of the day bed, and then heads downstairs. The house smells like freshly brewed coffee and bacon. The girl&#39;s mom looks away from the stove and smiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; she says brightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover responds shyly &ldquo;good morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s coffee in the pot if you&rsquo;d like some, and I&rsquo;m making eggs!&rdquo; She sings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover takes her coffee and sits in the living room with a very tired looking Taylor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo; Clover asks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; Taylor shrugs, and they leave it at that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a not so eventful morning with a ghost complaining about how she misses the taste of coffee and listing through her favorite flavors of creamers, while Clover does her best to pretend she&rsquo;s not there She leaves before the sisters. Chris was still asleep and Taylor had offered her a ride to the school but Clover decided to take the bus, and told her friend she&rsquo;d meet up with them later. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">No one&#39;s ideal day starts off with physics&hellip;or dead people. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost stares ahead at the droning teacher and the girl she was now haunting. &ldquo;Do you have any idea what he&rsquo;s talking about?&rdquo; The brunette makes a point to not look at her, but she sees her hand tick. The ghost gets up closer to her, and shouts into the girl&#39;s ear &ldquo;This is so boring!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover bites the inside of her cheek to keep from yelling back, because of course she knows it&rsquo;s boring! She doesn&#39;t need someone shouting in her ear about it! She looks down at her notebook and writes down what the teacher had written on the board.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t ignore me forever&hellip;&rdquo; The ghost leans her elbows on her desk&hellip; sort of. She can&rsquo;t actually lean on anything but she can float effortlessly &ldquo;sooner or later you&rsquo;ll have to accept that, you might as well do it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Nothing, no response from the girl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I saw your collection of spicy books in your closet, you wanna talk about those?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">That has Clover turning to look at her with furrowed brows looking more confused. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Ghost smirks &ldquo;tell me about them! I think I read a bunch of those when I was alive but I can&rsquo;t name any of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;CLOVER!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover looks at the teacher, a few others in the room glanced her way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry what?&rdquo; she asks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I haven&#39;t received your assignment yet,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...Assignment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The essay&rdquo; the teacher clarifies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The essay&rdquo; she repeats and thinks about how she had planned to do it the other night &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you need an extension see me later, my office will be open for a few hours today&rdquo; and he looks back down at his laptop.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost chuckles &ldquo;Ooohhh you&rsquo;re in trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover grips the paper in her hands, and takes a deep breath. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t answer her, do not even look at her&rsquo; &nbsp;every time she talks to that damn ghost something bad or embarrassing happens. She wasn&rsquo;t going to look at her again, if she pretended she wasn&rsquo;t there long enough she&rsquo;ll just go away, she&rsquo;ll have to get bored eventually right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The ghost ranted on and on about the text messages she was reading on a girls phone&hellip; across the room &ldquo;holy shit this is getting intense, apparently Julian is cheating on Gabrielle with someone named Jenny!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Just zone her out&rsquo; she repeats over and over in her head. She bawled her rage into a fist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;OH MY GOD! JENNYS PREGNANT!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like having a soap opera playing in her own head while no one else could hear it. She could barely listen to the teacher at all! Finally after the annoying 2 hours Clover stomps out of class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost floats with her through the hall &ldquo;That was a wild ride, when&#39;s the next time you have Physics class?! I need to catch up on her texts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you like her texts so much go follow her around!&rdquo; she grits out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Follow her?!&rdquo; The ghost gasps, putting a hand on her heart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not some weirdo stalker, people need privacy, that&rsquo;d just be rude.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover stops dead in her tracks, and glares up at Ghost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy from her class walks past lookin&hellip; concerned. Clover&rsquo;s reminded once again no one can see this really annoying girl that&#39;s right next to her, and she&rsquo;s standing in the hall looking at nothing but air! She starts walking again, putting her ear buds in and looking at the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear buds don&rsquo;t fully block her out, but they help some &ldquo;Why you walkin so fast?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover doesn&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;d care, when she could so effortlessly float after her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not how to make new friends,&rdquo; Ghost starts &ldquo;In fact it&rsquo;s kind of coming off as mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover purses her lips. Shooting Ghost a dark look from the corner of her eye. She walks in the library.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">She finds her normal table where she has been meeting up with Taylor and Chris. She throws her bag in one of the wooden chairs when someone puts a hand on her shoulder, she jumps. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">The hand is warm, and not the ghosts. She looks up at a tall guy with ruffled hair and weirdly nice cheekbones. Oh&hellip; he said something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Clover asks again, even taking out one of the earbuds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being really loud, your loud stomping, the librarian asked me to tell you to be a bit more respectful of the others here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face heats up &ldquo;right, sorry&rdquo; she squeaks out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles and walks away. Clover takes a deep breath and debates leaving, then she gets a text. She reads it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris - &lsquo;I FOUND SOMETHING COOL!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And absolutely nothing elaborating what it could be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover - &lsquo;what?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she waits for her friends she sits down and takes her laptop out. Keeping herself from looking around. She wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if people were staring at her after all that. She needed to get that essay done and email it to her teacher! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You should have done that sooner, it&rsquo;s never good to leave things till last second&rdquo; Ghost says. Sitting in the chair next to her like a living person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover clenches her fists and bites her tongue before she starts yelling in the library &ldquo;Please go away,&rdquo; she says through gritted teeth, bashing at the keys on her laptop.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Ghost frowns &ldquo;nope&rdquo; crosses her arms and leans back in the chair next to Clover.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">One of the two finds themselves rubbing their eyes and face, holding back screams of frustration. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly the chair Ghost is pretending to sit in is pulled back and Chris sits inside the ghost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Clover.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Clover stares at her friend with the also surprised Ghost girl sticking out of her shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Chris shivers &ldquo;why&rsquo;s it so cold in here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">A sweatshirt gets dropped on her head as Taylor walks past and to the chair on the other side of Clover. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop leaving that in my car, it smells&rdquo; Taylor says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Chris smells the sweater, squinting at it, shrugging and proceeding to put it on. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">Ghost sniffs as well, having a much different reaction to the sweatshirt in question. She floats out of Chris taking her spot in the fourth chair across from Clover. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Clover look!&rdquo; Chris takes a crumpled up yellow paper out of her pocket.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Chris shoves the paper in her face, Clover reads over the wrinkled paper &ldquo;a Talent contest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A talent contest!

The whip chose yoooou? So here I am?&rdquo; Ghosts sarcastic tone has Clover&rsquo;s eye twitching. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover quickly packs away her laptop and practically runs back to the dorms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the humidity is still heavy with the end of summer heat. Clover doesn&rsquo;t bother taking her sweatshirt off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Back to the dorm already? I thought you needed to finish your essay and go see your teacher&rdquo; Ghost says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover doesn&rsquo;t look at her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god! Ignore me or talk to me! PICK ONE!&rdquo; she groans &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so annooooying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I picked that one!

She needed to do this right now!! She couldn&rsquo;t stand another second of this Ghost! She needed her gone! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you so mad about?&rdquo; The ghost crosses her arms and they go into the elevator together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover thinks for a second that it&rsquo;s a bad idea to go into the small confined space with a ghost, but also&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d do anything. She trusted it that much. But nonetheless, she watched the ghost floating there the entire time. She looked more annoyed than anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the elevator dings on the second floor and she moves past the people getting on, the ghost floats through them, leaving shivers and goosebumps wherever she goes. Her dorm is&hellip; cleaner than the morning she left it. Not a single sign of glitter&hellip;. But it did smell like sewers and seaweed. She slams the door shut, she didn&rsquo;t think too hard about the other people in the building that might have heard it. She goes right for the drawer that she shoved that whip into.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing with that?&rdquo; The ghost asks, not liking the sinister smile on Clover&#39;s face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover pulls it out, the mess of shirts coming out with it &ldquo;You and it, are going to the big racoon that lives behind the school&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noooo we&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&#39;t you dare!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And what are you going to do about it?&rdquo; Clover smirks, and then walks through the freezing cold spirit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; The ghost yells, reaching out to Clover right as she touches the door knob.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a flash of light and Clovers once again in the blue and white spandex suit with glitter falling all around her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost blinks, looking from her hand to the wide eyed look on Clover&#39;s face &ldquo;... I&rsquo;m going to do that incase you were wondering!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clover looks down at ehr clothes and the floors, and back up at Ghost. She has a massive white tooth grin on her face, looking down at the now red head girl. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I Still think your outfit looks great.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;WHAT DID YOU DO?!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c5 c2"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1 c5 c2"><span class="c18"></span></p></body></html>
