<P class="Chapter1">The helicopters blare down on the girls, they swing erratically between them and 
    over the load of destruction and dead monster carcass. Cars start pulling up and people rush out,
     grabbing cameras and mics from the back of their vans. Officers arrive and set up barricades, 
     trying to keep them away from the massive squid-like body.

<P class="Chapter1">“Reporters! Please smile this time, Iris!” Ember smiles brightly at the purple girl.

<P class="Chapter1">Iris looks at the taller girl and raises her brows, frowning. Ember drops the smile.

<P class="Chapter1"> “I’ll deal with any of the bigger questions, don’t say anything Iris, last time you made it such a problem.” Ember pleads.
       
<P class="Chapter1">	Iris shrugs “I was just being truthful.”
<P class="Chapter1">  “Telling people that we don’t know why a massive bird decided to swoop down 
    and eat a random kid caused them all to panic.” Ember says sharply. 

        
<P class="Chapter1">  “Well we didn’t know how.” she crosses her arms.

<P class="Chapter1">	“UGH!” Ember's face grows red with anger “We don’t need to cause massive panic! 
    And if you’re going to do something like that again today, then leave.” 

<P class="Chapter1"> In a swish of purple, Iris was gone. 
 
<P class="Chapter1">  “Freaking Iris.” Ember clenches her teeth and fists.

<P class="Chapter1">“You know she does that to get out of the interviews, right?” Star points out.

<P class="Chapter1">  Ember takes a deep breath, and breathes out “I know…” she rubs her eyes.

<P class="Chapter1">  “What's happening?” Clover asks.

<P class="Chapter1">  “Oh um… you’re new that’s right. Just remember your PR training, and let me answer most of the questions.” 
    Ember waves her off,  “actually, you can just head out if you want, report back to OC.”

<P class="Chapter1"> “....OC?”
 
<P class="Chapter1"> “Work, you know, OC, we just abbreviate the name”
 
<P class="Chapter1">  Clover continues to look at her. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

<P class="Chapter1">  “What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about?” Ember asks.

<P class="Chapter1">  “I don't work anywhere, I don’t know what OC is.” 

<P class="Chapter1"> Both Star and Ember are stock still looking at her, they look at eachother, and back and Clover.
 
<P class="Chapter1">  Ember looks at the whip at Clover's hip “Where did you get that whip?”

<P class="Chapter1">  “HEY! Ember! Can we get an interview?!” A team of people are running up, lights and cameras in their faces. 
    Suddenly they’re surrounded by news reporters and journalists.

<P class="Chapter1">  “Why was the Kraken attacking?”

<P class="Chapter1"> “We’re not sure.” Ember responds easily.
 
<P class="Chapter1">  “Where did it come from? We’re miles from the nearest body of water!”

<P class="Chapter1">	“The sewers are most likely.” She replies.

<P class="Chapter1">“How could it? It’s huge?”

<P class="Chapter1">“It was a squid type kraken, they don’t have bones and can snake through fairly small spaces,” she explains. 

<P class="Chapter1">“Do you think there’s a chance more will be coming?”

<P class="Chapter1">“Kraken type Kaiju are solitary creatures, there's no chance of another coming by.” She says confidently.

<P class="Chapter1">Suddenly there's a mic in Clover's face.

<P class="Chapter1">“Channel 101 the Monster and Magical girl highlights, who are you?”

<P class="Chapter1">“...Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh” There's so many people looking at her. 

<P class="Chapter1">	She stares at the person's face, no answer coming to her mind. Mouth gaping.

<P class="Chapter1">“I…I’m…” 

<P class="Chapter1">Suddenly there’s an arm around her shoulder “She’s new!” Ember fills in
     “Still getting the hang of things, you should be nicer about shoving those mics in people’s faces!”
      She uses a finger and a bright smile to push it away. “Why don’t you introduce yourself?”

<P class="Chapter1">Clover just stares with wide eyes.

<P class="Chapter1">“We should get out of here.” 

<P class="Chapter1">The familiar voice causes her to look over. Instead of no one being there… 
    There's now A something. A see-through floating girl sort of something… smiling at her.

<P class="Chapter1">“What?” The faded girl raises a brow.

<P class="Chapter1">“Hello?” The reporter waves the mic in her face. “ New girl?”

<P class="Chapter1">	Ember nudges her just a little bit “Hey are you okay? You didn’t hit your head did you?”

<P class="Chapter1">“Ummm…” 

<P class="Chapter1">The ghost chuckles “Did you?”

<P class="Chapter1">In a flash of light Clover flies out of there. The power sending the reporters back and Ember stumbling just a bit. Even more confused than earlier.
