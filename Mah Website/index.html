<a  href="https://ko-fi.com/shinxune"> The Magical Girl Project</a>
<p class="Chapter1">  Rain pelts down from the sky heavy and hard. Clover holds her hood
    against her head, the material soaks up the water and the cold breeze freezes
    her to the bone. She shivers. The sun was setting and taking the warmth with it.
    <p class="Chapter1" >“It’s supposed to be summer! Why is it so cold?!” she whines.
    <p class="Chapter1"">She keeps moving forward against the icy breeze. She promised her friends she was going to meet them for dinner! And she was already closer to the restaurant than the dorms, there was no turning back.
